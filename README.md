# blockchain_scratch
This project involve implementation of a working blockchain in JS.
It involves -
Blocks structure, Genesis block creations.
Block mining.
Blockchain creation.
validation of the chain and taking longest chain into the consideration.
Add nonce into the hashing process, setting target ,mining rate, maintaning average mining rate and dynamic difficulties.
And finally making the chain distributive among the peers of the network and syncing them together.

Tools used-Postman(to test the get and post functionality) and redis server to implement distributive nature of the chain.
